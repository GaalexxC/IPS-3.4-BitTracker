# IPB 3.4x BitTorrent Tracker

A full featured bit torrent tracker module for IPB 3.4x versions. Like 3-4 years old, built with PHP 5.5 in prod, some good code in there for ideas, but no warranty whatsoever ladies and gentlemen. Some would say obsolete unless youre a player.

Play with it. I dont care.

I suggest installing on a Hyper-V dev board and not on a production board to test and modify.

#### Support

Doubt it

Upload folder bitracker to admin/applications_addon/other and run the install from adminCP

Thx Dan 'TG' Hamilton.
